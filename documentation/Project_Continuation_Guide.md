# Decentralized Identity Management on Algorand

## Project Overview

This document provides the next steps to continue developing a decentralized identity (DID) management system on the Algorand blockchain. The focus of this guide is on creating and deploying the main application, managing DID documents, and enabling DID creation for individual users.

## 1. Goals and Objectives

### Primary Goals

- **Deploy a Smart Contract** on Algorand for DID management (e.g., registration, data upload, updates).
- **Create and Manage DIDs for Users** so each user has a unique DID and associated data.
- **Implement DID Document Storage and Updates** to allow users to modify and verify their identities.

### Secondary Goals

- **Enable DID Resolution and Verification** to make DID documents accessible for authentication purposes.
- **Build a User-Friendly API** for the backend to allow seamless interactions with the DID functionality.

```

## 3. Steps to Continue the Project

### Step 1: Compile and Deploy the Smart Contract

1. **Compile the TEAL Scripts**: Use the Algorand CLI to compile the `approval.teal` and `clear.teal` files for deployment.

   ```bash
   goal clerk compile backend/contracts/approval.teal -o approval.tok
   goal clerk compile backend/contracts/clear.teal -o clear.tok
   ```

2. **Deploy the Application on Algorand**: Deploy the compiled application using the CLI. Replace `<creator-address>` with the actual address of the creator.

   ```bash
   goal app create        --creator <creator-address>        --approval-prog approval.tok        --clear-prog clear.tok        --global-byteslices 1        --global-ints 1        --local-byteslices 0        --local-ints 0
   ```

3. **Retrieve the App ID**: After successful deployment, note the application ID (APP_ID) displayed in the output. Add this ID to `config.py`:

   ```python
   # config.py
   APP_ID = 123456  # Replace with your generated APP_ID
   ```

### Step 2: Implement DID Creation for Users

1. **Define DID Creation Logic** in `did_management.py`:
   - Use Algorand SDK and TEAL scripts to create unique DIDs for each user.
   - Implement a function `create_did` that generates a DID, links it to a user's Algorand address, and stores any initial metadata.

   ```python
   # did_management.py
   from algosdk import account, mnemonic

   def create_did(user_address):
       # Logic to interact with the deployed app and register a new DID
       # ...
       return did_document
   ```

2. **User Registration and DID Generation**:
   - Update `registration.py` to integrate with the `create_did` function.
   - Upon registration, automatically generate a DID for the new user.

   ```python
   # registration.py
   from did_management import create_did

   def register_user():
       # Generate a new account, link DID
       user_did = create_did(user_address)
       return user_did
   ```

### Step 3: Manage and Update DID Documents

1. **Implement DID Document Update Functionality** in `did_update.py`:
   - Add methods for users to update their DID document.
   - Store data related to verification methods, authentication keys, etc.

   ```python
   # did_update.py
   def update_did(did, new_data):
       # Logic to update DID document on Algorand
       # ...
       return updated_did_document
   ```

2. **Integrate with API Endpoints** in `main.py`:
   - Ensure `main.py` has endpoints to manage the complete DID lifecycle: registration, updates, and retrieval.

   ```python
   # main.py
   from fastapi import FastAPI
   from registration import register_user
   from did_update import update_did

   app = FastAPI()

   @app.post("/register")
   def register():
       return register_user()

   @app.put("/update_did")
   def update_did_endpoint(did, new_data):
       return update_did(did, new_data)
   ```

### Step 4: Verification and Data Display

1. **Retrieve and Display DID Data**: Use `data_display.py` to fetch DID details.
2. **Authenticate Users**: Leverage `authentication.py` to validate user identities based on their DIDs.

### Step 5: Dockerize and Run the Application

1. **Backend Docker Setup**: Use `Dockerfile` in the backend folder for containerization.
2. **Launch with Docker Compose** (optional): Configure `docker-compose.yml` to run the backend and any associated services.

## 4. Testing and Validation

- **Unit Tests**: Implement unit tests for each module to ensure functionality.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Validate DID creation, updating, and retrieval via the API.

## Conclusion

With these steps, you’ll have a fully operational DID management system on Algorand, allowing for decentralized identity registration, updates, and user authentication.
